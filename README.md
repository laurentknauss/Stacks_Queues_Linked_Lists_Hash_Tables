# **Stacks , Queues, LinkedLists & HashTables in Golang** 

Stacks & queues are basic linear data strcutures.
Both have flexible size , meaning they grow and shrink dynamically as you take in & take out data.
The difference between a stack & a queue is the way data is removed.<br>

In a stack design  , this is Last In , First Out. ( like a stack of  books in real life, if you want to remove a book from that stack<br>
you have to take away the book which is on top & this book was in fact the last one to be put there.<br>

In a queue design , this is First In , First out (like a queue in a supermarket) . <br>
